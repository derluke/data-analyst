#### ⚙️ **Setting up Harness release-to-datarobot-community pipeline**

You can set up Harness pipelines once you have `.harness/` on the default branch of your repository:

* Copy `projectIdentifier` value from `.harness/pipeline-release.yml` for the future project name;
* Create a new project
  on [Harness](https://app.harness.io/ng/account/oP3BKzKwSDe_4hCFYw_UWA/module/ci/orgs/No_Code_Apps/projects) using the name
  from step **1**;
* Navigate to the [Pipelines](https://app.harness.io/ng/account/oP3BKzKwSDe_4hCFYw_UWA/module/ci/orgs/No_Code_Apps/projects/data-analyst/pipelines) section and click a down-arrow symbol on the `Create a Pipeline button`;
* Click `Import from Git`;
* Select `Third-party Git provider`. Choose a Git connector, your repository - `data-analyst`, and path to
  the release configuration - `.harness/pipeline-release.yml`;
* Click `Import` to complete the setup process;

This will create a pipeline that creates a tag in the corresponding `datarobot-community` GitHub repository.\

To make it work automatically, you will need to add a trigger:

* Click `Triggers` at the top;
* Click `New Trigger` and select `GitHub`;
* Switch to a YAML-view mode by clicking `YAML` at the top;
* Paste a YAML configuration from `.harness/trigger-release.yml` and click `Create Trigger` at the bottom of the page;

Now you should have a working pipeline that creates a tag in the corresponding repo of `datarobot-community` GitHub
org once you create such in the private `datarobot` org repo.
